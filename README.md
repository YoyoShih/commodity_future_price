# Shrinkage Regression in Python

This repository contains a **Python implementation of shrinkage regression estimators**, translated from the original **R code and methodology** provided by Asimit, V., Cidota, MA., Chen, Z., and Asimit, J. in [\[savvySh\]](https://github.com/Ziwei-ChenChen/savvySh/tree/main).  

The goal of this project is to make these methods more accessible in Python, and to apply them in a **quantitative finance context**, specifically for **commodity futures prediction and portfolio construction**.

## üîπ Background

Shrinkage regression is a class of estimators designed to improve prediction accuracy by trading off bias and variance.  
This project implements:  

- **Stein Estimator (St)**  
- **Diagonal Shrinkage (DSh)**  
- **Linear Shrinkage (LSh)**  
- **Slab Regression (SR, GSR)**  
- **Shrinkage Ridge Regression (SRR)**  

---

## üîπ My Contribution

- Translated the original **R implementations** into **Python**.  
- Verified correctness against the R version on toy datasets.  
- Applied these methods to a **dataset of 35 commodity futures**, predicting future returns.   
- Compared shrinkage estimators against **OLS** in terms of **out-of-sample MSE**.  

Currently doing:
- Constructed **long-short portfolios** based on predicted returns.

## üîπ Results (Example)

Using a rolling-window backtest (3 years training ‚Üí 1 months prediction) and applying Stein estimators and Diagonal Shrinkage regression.  

Note that for simplicity, here we only consider front-month contract (cc1).

Mean Square Error of Prediction (over each commodity)
- OLS: mean 0.0261, std 0.0519 (over each year)  
- **Stein**: **mean 0.0183, std 0.0348 (over each year)**
- **Diagonal Shrinkage**: **mean 0.0186, std 0.0366 (over each year)** 

To backtest a long-short portfolio based on the prediction of return, we now introduced second-nearby contract data to bring us more close to reality.

Long-short Portfolio's Sharpe Ratio
- OLS: 2.8523
- Stein: 2.7349
- **Diagonal Shrinkage**: **3.0752**

## üîπ Future Improvement

While there has been some initial results achieved, obviously there are still many things to do, including but not limit to:
- Data issue: Adding more commodity futures data; Data correctness issue solving; Try other index or other target's futures
- Model: Try GLM instead of MLS
- Strategy: Considering more complex trading strategies

## üîπ Usage

```python
from model.savvy_sh import SavvySh

# Fit a multiplicative shrinkage model
model = SavvySh(model_class="Multiplicative", include_Sh=True)
result = model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
